# Reinforcement Learning course

## [Laboratory work 1](https://github.com/alexpetr0v/reinforcement-learning-course/tree/master/lab1)

 - The task is to solve the reinforcement learning problems by the method of cross-entropy;
 - Prove convergence of Policy Iteration by proving contraction and monotonicity;
 - You need to implement Q Learning Agent in vanilla Q-learning algorithm and use it on a number of tests.

## [Laboratory work 2](https://github.com/alexpetr0v/reinforcement-learning-course/tree/master/lab2)

 - You need to teach the Pytorch neural network to perform Q-learning;
 - Implement DQN — an approximate Q-learning algorithm with experience replay and target networks — and see if it works better this way.

## [Laboratory work 3](https://github.com/alexpetr0v/reinforcement-learning-course/tree/master/lab3)

 - Define a model for REINFORCE algorithm, that predicts action probabilities given states;
 - Train RL agent for atari [Kung Fu Master](https://www.gymlibrary.ml/environments/atari/kung_fu_master/?highlight=kungfu), this time using recurrent neural networks;
 - Implement a vanilla MCPC planning.
